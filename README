PDL::McIDAS allows you to read into PDL the McIDAS GRID files. There
is also a function to plot RGB images.

Prerequisites - You need to have the perl PDL module installed.
http://pdl.perl.org

Build and Install:

$ zcat PDL-McIDAS-xx.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd PDL-McIDAS-xx
$ perl Makefile.pl
$ make

$ make install

Changes / enhancements you plan to make in the future:

Read McIDAS IMAGES into PDL.

In the more distant future: plot images and grids together
with the same projection.
